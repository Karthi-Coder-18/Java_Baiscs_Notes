IP ADDRESS

# Each network running TCP/IP must have a unique network number, and      
  every machine on it must have a unique IP address. 

# IP ADDRESS = Network Part + Host Part 

  Ex: 129.39 + 50.56

# IP Address Uniquely Identifies your Machine on Internet 

# This form of representing the bytes of an IP address is often    
  referred to as the dotted-decimal format.

# Network Part  : This part specifies the unique number assigned to 
                  your network. 

# Host Part : This is the part of the IP address that you assign to each host. It uniquely identifies this machine on your network.
 
            : Note that for each host on your network, the network part of the address will be the same, but the host part must be different.


* So if two devices are on same network then the network part of the IP address will be same for the both, but the Host part will be different. 


* IP Address may get changed when we change the networks or turn off and on the network.
