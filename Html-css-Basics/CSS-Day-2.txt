There are 3 Ways of styling in CSS

1. In-line : Here we can style them inside the HTML element itself. 
 
            Ex: <button style="";></button> [ Learn how to write multiple in-line Style attributes ] 

2. Internal CSS : we can write the CSS code for HTML elements inside the STYLE element 

                 Ex : <style>.name-btn {;} </style>
                      
                      <button class : name-btn> </button>

3. External CSS : We can create a seperate CSS file with .css Extension & Link that CSS file inside HTML code.
