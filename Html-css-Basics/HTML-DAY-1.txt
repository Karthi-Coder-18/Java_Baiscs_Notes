HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language 

1.HTML ELEMENTS

# HTML & CSS is used to create Websites that we use on daily basis

# It is basically giving instructions to our computer how to display the website which we interact with. 


# Whatever content we would like to show to the user we will write that inside the HTML ELEMENTS which will be wirtten inside SYNTAX 

# In Coding if you don't follow the Rules of coding ( Syntax ) then computer cannot understand what kind of instruction we are giving. 

# How do you write the HTML ELEMENTS 

 Ex: <button>Hey man!!</button> 

 * Here <> </> these are called as tags. Inside them we will write our HTML ELEMENTS & between them we will write our Content which we wanted to display on 
   the website. 



2. HTML ATTRIBUTES 

# We Know that we use HTML ELEMENTS for displaying the content on our website. So what if we want to re-direct the user from our website to another here comes Attributes to help us 

# HTML ATTRIBUTES are something that which tells what should the Elements need to do if some changes are required. 

# Here for Example if we need to link an website then we need to use   [  <a> </a> = This is called as ANCHOR ELEMENT ] The Anchor element in HTML will re-direct the user to another website from current website. 

# To make it happen we need to use HTML ATTRIBUTES to provide the link of the another website. there are certain rules for how to write the attributes inside a element. 


Rules for Inserting Attributes inside HTML Elements

* There should be space between Element & Attribute.

* The Value of the Attribute should be covered inside inverted commas [ "" ] 

* Ex: <a herf="google.com"> Go here </a>  here [ href is Attribute name, "google.com" is the website link, Go here is the text with which the link is    
      associated to. 

# If we don't mention any TARGET attribute for href, then the new website will open inside the same tab. If we want to open it in new tab then we must 
  provide TARGET attribute after href 

Ex : <a href="cricbuzz.com" target="_blank"> Virat stats </a>


!!! The href & target Attributes will only work inside Anchor Element <a></a>  !!!


## HTML WILL IGONRE THE EXTRA SPACES INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE ATTRIBUTES OR ELEMENTS 

## HTML WILL ALSO IGNORE THE NEW LINES OF OUR ELEMENTS. 

## INDENT / INDENTATION is space between the start of the new line & code we write. We can change it in VSCODE in settings> tabsize [ default is 4 ] 

#If we write the code for both the buttons side by side on same line then they will be view as side by side 

ex: <button>hi</button> <button>bro</button>
