# In CSS we use WIDTH Property to force the text to go into New line !!! Also by decreasing the value of width property the content will adjust accordingly 
  with newer lines. 

# LINE-HEIGHT CSS property is used to set the distance between lines of text. This is like setting the space between the lines. [ Do check this once ] 

# By Default the <p> paragraph element comes with A Margin of some value maybe!!!

# HTML ENTITY : These are some special characters. For example like tickmark or star or asterisk etc...

# To reset the default margin of any direction for a HTML element we need to set it to 0. 

  Ex: margin-top : 0; 



## If we want to set the default/same CSS proeprty for all the HTML elements present then we can style them like below 

   Ex : p { font-family : arial; Margin-top : 0; } - This styling wll reflect to all the Paragraphs present in our Web page, thus eliminating the duplicates. 



# ex:     

<style>

p 
{
  background-color: aliceblue;
  margin-top: 0;
}

.btn-1
{
  background-color: beige;
  margin-top: 20px;
}

</style> 




For the above CSS code we can see that margin top property has been assigned to an Paragraph element twice. So which value does web browser takes ? 

A: This will depends on the CSS SPECIFICITY, basically p represents all the paragraphs in web page, but .btn-1 will specifically represents an Button. So 
   due to this reason margin top : 20p will be applied to that specific HTML element. 


# Here P & .btn-1 is called as Selectors. 

# Class Name Selector > Element name S



# <Span> </Span>  - Span tag in HTML is used only if we had to style specific part of Text in a paragraph or headings or text. 

  We can add a class name and we can style it in whatever way we want to.
