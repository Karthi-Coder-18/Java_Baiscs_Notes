HTML Structure 


# we have follow the below structure for creating web pages using HTML 
  
  <!Doctype = HTML>        : This doctype element is used to let the Webpage know that we are using an HTML document. 
 
  <html>                   : The HTML element is a root element that defines the whole HTML document. 

  <head>                   : In HEAD element we do use the content which is not displayed on the website. ex: webpage name, linking css file, adding fonts

  </head>

  <body>                   : Body element is used to display the content which we wanted to show to the user. 


  </body> 

  </html>
 




# Inside the Head element there are two major elements which we can use 

  1. <title> </title>  : This element is used to display the title of the webpage which we are using. 

  2. <link> : this is a void element which do not have closing tag. do have two attributes 

              i. rel : attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document.
   
              ii. href : This attribute is used to link the css file. 


Note :  <style> </style> - If we don't create a seperate CSS file, then the Style element should be used inside the head element as per the HTML structure. 

     

1. An element inside a element is called as Nesting. ex: HTML Structure. 

2. The LIVE SERVER Extension will not work properly if we doesn't have a proper HTML structure in our code. 

3. VOID elements in HTML doesn't require a closing tag !!! 
( There are multiple void elements : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Void_element) 

4. FILE PATHS : File paths in HTML are used to locate certain file when required. 

   Syntax : href : " filename/html or css file name "


5. GOOGLE FONTS : From this website we can find different types of Fonts which we can use for our website. We can add the link of those fonts in head element. 
   
                  ( Link  : https://fonts.google.com/ )
