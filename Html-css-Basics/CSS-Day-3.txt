HOWERS / TRANSITIONS / SHADOWS  IN CSS 

1.HOWERS : These are called as Pesudo-Class. Basically these howers will add extra style for HTML Elements 

           These needs to be seperated from Styling code and written seperately. 

           Ex: .btn-color:hover { background-color : grey; }  - Whatever styling we make here it only reflect when the user hovers over the HTML element. 


2. ACTIVE : In CSS Active Property will change the Styling of HTML element when we click on it 

            Ex: .btn-color:active { background-color : yellow; }

3. OPACITY : This Property in CSS is used to  [ Fade out / Fade In ]  the HTML Element. It can be done by providing values between 0 to 1 

             Ex: .btn-color:active { opacity : 0.5; }
           
             Here 0 will completely fade out the element & 1 will make it visible clearly. 


4. TRANSITION : Transition is something that which let's us to change the default changing time when we hover on a HTML Element. 
   
                Ex: .btn-color { opacity 1s; } here we need to provide two values [ one is the Property which is used in Hover Styling & another is timing 
                     of transition ] 
 
                In Transition property if we have to add multiple HTML Attributes then we can just add comma after each one of them 

                Ex: .btn-color { background-color : red, color:blue;}


5. SHADOWS : Shadows will create a transparent around the HTML element. 

             Ex: .btn-tweet {box-shadow : 0,0,0,color;} 4 values need to be provided [ Horizental , Vertical , Blurred, Color ] 
             
             For Shadows to work properly we can use RGBA [ here A stands for Opacity ]
