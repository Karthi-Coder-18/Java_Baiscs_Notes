 * In any Coding language Code is case sensitive
 * Whenever you run your code the Java Compiler(javac) takes your code & turns it into Bytes code which is computer readable format. 
 * Once it is converted to Byte code, the code will be stored in [ .class file ]
 * 
 * Then JDK will run your code. JDK will look for MAIN{} method, Main method is where JDK looks for running the code. Main is the entry point for running your application.
 * 
 * Then JDK will go line after line to execute your code. 
 * 
 * Always Compile your code first with command [javac filename.java]
 * Execute new Byte code with this command[java filename]
