/*
 * Comparison is useful when it is inside If statement. 
 * When Comparison is inside the Statement then it is called as Condition. 
 * 
 * If Statement will run the code inside it only if the Condition is true, if it is false it will run the else statement. 
 * 
 * ELSE IF Statement inside IF statement !!!
 * 
 * Else If is used to compare multiple conditions inside If statement. 
 * 
 * Java runs through the conditons one after another & print the condition which is true & Ignores the rest. If all the conditions are false then it will print Else statement.
