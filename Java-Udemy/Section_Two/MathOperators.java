/*
 * While coding/Printing both String & Primitive Data types together we need to be careful. 
 * 
 * As we need to code the String values inside "" . And Primitive data types inside () .
 * 
 * 
 * PATTREN : 
 * 
 * An Operation between two whole numbers always returns a Whole number.
 * 
 * An operation between two decimals will always returns decimals. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * MATH OPERATIONS 
 * 
 * 1. + ( plus ) : This is used to add two values & also used to concat String values 
 * 
 * 2. - ( Minus ) : This is used to Subtract two values 
 * 
 * 3. * ( asterisk ) : This is used to Multiply two values 
 * 
 * 4. / ( Division ) : This is used to divide two values. 
 * 
 * 5. % ( Modulus )  : This will divides the two values & returns us back remainder of the operation. 
 * 
 * 6. ++ ( Increment ) : This operation will increase the value of variable by 1. Common for INT
 * 
 * 7. -- ( Decrement ) : This operation will decrease the value of the variable by 1. Common in INT.
 * 
 * 8. += ( Add by )  : This operation will add the value which we provdide to right side of it. 
 * 
 * 9. -= ( subtract by) : This operation will subtract the value provided right side of it. 
 *
