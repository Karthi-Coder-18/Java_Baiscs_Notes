 /*
     * A variable can store values 
     * Think of it as a box & we will store our required information in that box 
     * we require 3 values for a variable to be created [ Variable Type Variable Name = Variable Value ]
     * 
     * Remember Every line of code in JAVA NEEDS TO END WITH A SEMI-COLON !!!!!
     * 
     * Naming Convention in JAVA 
     * 
     * 1. Class name should be always CamelCase [ First letter of each word should be capital]
     * 2. Vairable name should be always lowerCamelCase [ 1st letter of 1st word should be small 
     *     & 1st letter of followed words should be capital ]
     * 
     * JAVA  is Strongly Typed [ It means if your try to give the value that which doesn't match the variable type it throws us a type mismatch error ]
     * 
     * Setting Variables to each other [ while creating a new variable if we want to assign same value as old variable then we can assign the old variable name as value to the newer one. ] 
     * 
     *   Ex: int ok = 2;
     *       int kk = ok; || This will print 2 for both vairables.
