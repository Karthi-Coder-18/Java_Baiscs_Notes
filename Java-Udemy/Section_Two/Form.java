/*
 * A Character in JAVA can only store one Alphabet.
 * 
 * Syntax : char role = 'B';
 * 
 * A character can be stored inside single quotes & Stringswill be stored inside Double Quotes. 
 * 
 * Why don't we need string everytime than using Char : Char takes less memory & provides faster 
 * performence. 
 * 
 * Here char is a primitive data type & String is an Object !!!!
