 * 
 * LONG variable is used to store large 
 * LONG variable can store numbers upto 9 Quintillion. We need to add [ L ] at the end of variable value 
 * to let Javac know that we are using a long Variable. 
 * 
 * Memory LONG variable takes is 8 bytes.
 * 
 *  LONG OR INT : It basically depends on perfromence of application. If we choose Int it only takes 4 bytes so our app perfromence will be better.
